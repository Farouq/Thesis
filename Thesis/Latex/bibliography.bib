abstract = {Plagiarism is a widespread problem in assessment tasks; in computing courses, students often plagiarise source code. For all but the smallest classes, manual detection of such plagiarism is impractical, and, while automated tools are available, none has been applied to detect inter-lingual plagiarism, where source code is copied from one language to another. In this work, we propose a novel approach, XPlag, to detect plagia-rism involving multiple languages using intermediate program code produced by a compiler suite. We de-scribe experiments to evaluate XPlag, and show that we can detect inter-lingual plagiarism with reasonably good precision.},

The papers address a wide range of topics in research (foundations track) and practice (applications track). For the first time a new category of research papers, vision papers, are included presenting "outside the box" thinking. The foundations track received 167 full paper submissions, of which 34 were selected for presentation. Out of these, 3 papers were vision papers. The application track received 27 submissions, of which 13 papers were selected for presentation. The papers are organized in topical sections on model transformation, model complexity, aspect oriented modeling, analysis and comprehension of models, domain specific modeling, models for embedded systems, model synchronization, model based resource management, analysis of class diagrams, verification and validation, refactoring models, modeling visions, logics and modeling, development methods, and model integration and collaboration.},

In the present paper (as in [1]) we investigate a channel model in which it is also possible to have failures of the form 0 -{\textgreater} $\Lambda$, 1 -{\textgreater} $\Lambda$, which are called deletions, and failures of the form $\Lambda$ -{\textgreater} 0, $\Lambda$ -{\textgreater} 1, which are called insertions (here $\Lambda$ is the empty word). For such channels, by analogy to the combinatorial problem of constructing optimal codes capable of correcting s reversals, we will consider the problem of constructing optimal codes capable of correcting deletions, insertions, and reversals.},

The results from an analysis of 200 weeks of evolution of five software system show that the stability as measured by changes to the system is dominated by the deletion of code clones. It can also be observed that additions to a systems are more often additions to non-cloned code than additions to cloned code. If the dominating factor of deletions is eliminated, it can generally be concluded that cloned code is more stable than non-cloned code.},

abstract = {Code clones are said to threaten the maintainability of a system -- especially when the system evolves and source code is changed. Whether clones truly increase maintenance effort can be analyzed by comparing the stability of cloned code to the stability of non-cloned code. A previous study found that cloned code is even more stable than non-cloned code and, thus, requiring less maintenance effort -- contrary to the frequently voiced assumption. In this paper, we describe our partial replication and extension of this study using a more detailed measurement and considering different parameters for clone detection. In general, we were able to validate the findings of the previous study. We furthermore explored possible reasons to gain a better understanding of the unintuitive results.},

Without substantial research on the economic consequences of software clones, clone management will remain a questionable or even risky activity. Knowing how much effort is spent over the lifetime of a program to maintain source code that has been introduced in consequence of a deliberate clone removal might provide useful information in this respect. In this paper I present a framework to track code fragments that have been introduced by refactorings performed to remove existing code duplications. Tracking such code over time allows to investigate different aspects, for instance change frequency, that provide valuable insights regarding ongoing maintenance costs.},

The framework allows for the development of similar applications in different languages through the reuse of core libraries. As a result of such a multi-language development, the identification and trace ability of similar code fragments (clones) becomes a key challenge. In this paper, we present a clone detection approach for the .NET language family. The approach is based on the Common Intermediate Language, which is generated by the .NET compiler for the different languages within the .NET framework. In order to achieve an acceptable recall while maintaining the precision of our detection approach, we define a set of filtering processes to reduce noise in the raw data. We show that these filters are essential for Intermediate Language-based clone detection, without significantly affecting the precision of the detection approach. Finally, we study the quantitative and qualitative performance aspects of our clone detection approach. We evaluate the number of reported candidate clone-pairs, as well as the precision and recall (using manual validation) for several open source cross-language systems, to show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

@inproceedings{Baxter1998,
abstract = {Existing research suggests that a considerable fraction (5-10{\%}) of the source code of large scale computer programs is duplicate code (“clones”). Detection and removal of such clones promises decreased software maintenance costs of possibly the same magnitude. Previous work was limited to detection of either near misses differing only in single lexems, or near misses only between complete functions. The paper presents simple and practical methods for detecting exact and near miss clones over arbitrary program fragments in program source code by using abstract syntax trees. Previous work also did not suggest practical means for removing detected clones. Since our methods operate in terms of the program structure, clones could be removed by mechanical methods producing in-lined procedures or standard preprocessor macros. A tool using these techniques is applied to a C production software system of some 400 K source lines, and the results confirm detected levels of duplication found by previous work. The tool produces macro bodies needed for clone removal, and macro invocations to replace the clones. The tool uses a variation of the well known compiler method for detecting common sub expressions. This method determines exact tree matches; a number of adjustments are needed to detect equivalent statement sequences, commutative operands, and nearly exact matches. We additionally suggest that clone detection could also be useful in producing more structured code, and in reverse engineering to discover domain concepts and their implementations},

abstract = {This paper examines the effectiveness of a new language- specific parser-based but lightweight clone detection approach. Exploiting a novel application of a source transformation system, the method accurately finds near-miss clones using an efficient text line comparison technique. The transformation system assists the method in three ways. First, using agile parsing it provides user-specified flexible pretty- printing to remove noise, standardize formatting and break program statements into parts such that potential changes can be detected as simple linewise text differences. Second, it provides efficient flexible extraction of potential clones to be compared using island grammars and agile parsing to select granularities and enumerate potential clones. Third, using transformation rules it provides flexible code normalization to allow for local editing differences between similar code segments and filtering out of uninteresting parts of potential clones. In this paper we introduce the theory and practice of the framework and demonstrate its use in finding function clones in C code. Early experiments indicate that the method is capable of finding near-miss clones with high precision and recall, and with reasonable performance.},

abstract = {Code duplication or copying a code fragment and then reuse by pasting with or without any modifications is a well known code smell in software maintenance. Several studies show that about 5{\%} to 20{\%} of a software systems can contain duplicated code, which is basically the results of copying existing code fragments and using then by pasting with or without minor modications. One of the major shortcomings of such duplicated fragments is that if a bug is detected in a code fragment, all the other fragments similar to it should be investigated to check the possible existence of the same bug in the similar fragments. Refactoring of the duplicated code is another prime issue in software maintenance although several studies claim that refactoring of certain clones are not desirable and there is a risk of removing them. However, it is also widely agreed that clones should at least be detected. In this paper, we survey the state of the art in clone detection research. First, we describe the clone terms commonly used in the literature along with their corresponding mappings to the commonly used clone types. Second, we provide a review of the existing clone taxonomies, detection approaches and experimental evaluations of clone detection tools. Applications of clone detection research to other domains of software engineering and in the same time how other domain can assist clone detection research have also been pointed out. Finally, this paper concludes by pointing out several open problems related to clone detection research.},

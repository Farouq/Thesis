% THESIS TITLE
% Specify the title. Set the capitalization how you want it.
\title{Semantic clone detection and benchmarking}
%\title{Using Ontology and Intermediate Language to Detect Semantic and Cross Language Clones}

% AUTHOR'S NAME
% Your name goes here.
\author{Farouq Al-omari}

% DEGREE SOUGHT.  
% Use \MSc or \PhD here
\degree{\PhD}         

% THESIS DEFENCE DATE
% Should be month/year, e.g. July 2004
\defencedate{December/2017}


% NAME OF ACADEMIC UNIT
%
% The following two commands allow you to specify the academic unit you belong to.
% This will appear on the title page as
% ``<academic unit> of <department>''.
% So if you are in the division of biomedical engineering you would need to do:
% \department{Biomedical Engineering}
% \academicunit{Division}
%
% The default is ``Department of Computer Science'' if these commands
% are not given.
%
% If you are in a discipline other than Computer Science, uncomment the following line and
% specify your discipline/department.  Default is 'Computer Science'.
% \department{If not Computer Science, put the name of your department here}

% If you are not in a department, but say, a division, uncomment the following line.
% \academicunit{Put the type of academic unit you belong to here, e.g. Division, College}


% PERMISSION TO USE ADDRESS
%
% If you are not in Comptuer Science you will want to change the
% address on the Permission to Use page.  This is done using the
% \ptuaddress{}.  Example:
%
% \ptuaddress{Head of the Department of Computer Science\\
% 176 Thorvaldson Building\\
% 110 Science Place\\
% University of Saskatchewan\\
% Saskatoon, Saskatchewan\\
% Canada\\
% S7N 5C9

% ABSTRACT
\abstract{
	
Developers copy and paste their code to speed up the development process. Some-times, they copy code from an open source system and reuse it with or without modifications. The resulted similar or identical code fragments in terms of syntax or semantic are called code clones. Software cloning researches indicate the existence of code clones in all software systems; on average 5\% to 20\% of software code is cloned. Due to clones impact, either positive or negative impacts, its important to locate, track and manage them in the source code. Many techniques for detecting code clones have been proposed. However, a recent study shows that existing techniques have a limitation in detecting semantic clones. In this research, we proposed different techniques using intermediate language and ontology to detect clones across programming languages and semantic clones. We evaluated the efficiency of our techniques and compare it to start-of-art detection tools. Finally, we proposed a methodology to create a functional clone oracle that help researcher in this area to evaluate their tools.

% Since thesis chapters are very long and there are a lot of them, it is recommended
% that you put each chapter in a separate .tex file and \input each one of them
% in order.  For example:
%
% \input chap1.tex
% \input chap2.tex
% ...
%
% The \input command inserts contents of the specified file at the point of the command.

% The Bibliograpy should go here. BEFORE appendices!

% Typeset the Bibliography.  The bibliography style used is "plain".
% Optionally, you can specify the bibliography style to use:
% \uofsbibliography[stylename]{yourbibfile}

%


%\bibliographystyle{plain}

\uofsbibliography{bibliography}
% If you are not using bibtex, comment the line above and uncomment

%Follow the line below with a thebibliography environmentand bibitems.  
% Note: use of bibtex is usually the preferred method.

% APPENDICES
%
% Any chapters appearing after the \appendix command get numbered with
% capital letters starting with appendix 'A'.
% New chapters from here on will be called 'Appendix A', 'Appendix B'
% as opposed to 'Chapter 1', 'Chapter 2', etc.

% Activate thesis appendix mode.

% Put appendix chapters in the appendices environment so that they appear correcty
% in the table of contents.  You can use \input's here as well.
